# OmegaFaker
A Faker for Greenworks GW and other Battery types Omega Port faking

Tested with:
- Greenworks Leaf Blower 40V - Works!

Actual only 40V Batterys ar supported, other comming soon
Use:
- Grab a Arduino or someelse with a Atmega 328P or higher that have 16mhz
- edit the settings, or not
- Put the code on the Atmega
- Connect ground to the ground from the Battery/Machine
- Connect the pin you would use to the Ohm / Omega port, when you plan tu use orginal Batterys and other, cut the Dataline and connect it to the Pin.
- You need 5V for the Arduino, so in some machine harnes you will find it at the hall sensor cable, or you need a [Xl7015](https://www.google.com/search?q=xl7015+dc-dc+step+down) (100V max.) DC-DC Module to get 5V
